> It is a matter of immense pleasure for us to be able to launch "CB Labs", an idea
we had been toying with for quite some time now.

At [Coding Blocks](http://codingblocks.com), among other things,
we enthusiastically support and promote _free and open-source
software development_, and take pride in being hosts of events such as _**Google Summer of Code**_ meetups.
And in a way, our influence rubbing off, many of our _Android_ and _Web Development_ course graduates
have taken to contribute to FOSS projects, and a few of them even starting to work on
their own apps, web apps and games, which have become popular among their friends.

To both, be able to have a platform to reconnect with our former students, and in general
promote and foster open-source development projects, we are starting off a tiny effort called
**Coding Blocks Labs**.

## Coding Blocks Labs

### So, what is it?
CB Labs is nothing but a collection of a handful of open-source web and mobile app projects.
Some of them are tools we at _Coding Blocks_ require and will use ourselves, including some
tools and games to make the process of _learning to code_ easier.
There would also be projects pertaining to the life of college students (who happen to be the
largest chunk of our students)

While we are seeding CB Labs with a few projects of our own, if you are working on any project
of our own and want to make it a part of CB Labs, you are more than welcome.

### Awesome, what are the projects?

To begin with there are a few projects like -

- **Code Quiz**
   - **[Webapp](/projects/question-of-the-day--webapp/)**: An admin dashboard where people can register and log-in.
   Those who have admin access can add new questions.
   - **Android**: An Android app, which anyone can use. People get a question
   every day, and get points based on how fast they answer it after seeing it.

- **URL Shortner**
  - A URL shortener, with link follow analytics, written in NodeJS.

- **Algorithm Visualiser**
  - Android and Web apps to visualize various algorithms and their data structures

More projects will be made part of CB Labs. Keep an eye out on
**[lab.codingblocks.com](http://lab.codingblocks.com)**

### Knock, knock, how do I get in?
As with open-source projects, there are usually no _doors_ (or _Windows_, lol).
Stay informed about the projects via **[the labs page](http://lab.codingblocks.com)**
and if any project interests you, check out it's GitHub repo.

You should find an ample number of issues and bugs to start contributing to. We'll try
our best to keep all projects under CB Labs well documented, and easy to get involved
with. (And if not, then documentation is a task itself, that you can pick up)

For many students who often wonder what projects they can start with, after having just
learned some new technology like Android app development, we hope to provide a good place to start.
Also for those who have recently started working on their very own projects and are looking
to showcase it and collaborate with others, CB Labs could be a great platform.

I hope that via _**Coding Blocks Labs**_ we'll not only be able to reconnect with our
previous students, but also create a community of open-source developers, working on
solving actual problems around **tech education** and **lives of college students**.
