At **[Coding Blocks](http://codingblocks.com)**, most of us come from
a vibrant _Open Source_ Community,
and that makes us strongly believe in free and open source software.

Each year we teach hundreds of students coding, programming and software
development. Over the past three years (we started off in April 2014), we
have helped more than 1500 students gain expertise in Android, Web, Data Science
and more.

To be able to stay connected with our alumni, and reach out the wider
community of budding software developers, we are launching an annual summer
programme  - **BOSS** which stands for _**Bountiful Open Source Summer**_

We're taking inspiration from other such open source summer programmes like
_Google Summer of Code_, _Google Code-In_, _Summer of KDE_, _RGSoC_ and
many others to start our own programme to engage all of you via **BOSS**

## How will it work ?

At Coding Blocks we have a number of open source projects going on
which on can find here -

#### <http://github.com/coding-blocks>

The objective is to get involved in these projects via contributions
through Github (in form of Pull Requests).

BOSS 2017 starts from **15th May 2017**, after which you'll find
most of our repositories will have issues marked with a _**bounty amount**_

You can check a couple of such issues for example -
 - [issue-7, shortlr](https://github.com/coding-blocks/shortlr/issues/7)
 - [issue-8, shortlr](https://github.com/coding-blocks/shortlr/issues/8)
 - [issue-10, oneauth](https://github.com/coding-blocks/oneauth/issues/10)

More such issues with bounties will be made by 15th May, and will
continuously  keep getting created.

The more bounties you collect, the higher you are on the leaderboard.
To top 10 students as on **15th August 2017** will be BOSS 2017 Winners.

## How to participate ?

Two steps basically.

 1. Pick any open issue **[from here](https://github.com/issues?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3ABOSS+org%3Acoding-blocks)**, solve it and send a pull request to us.
 2. Go to the **[BOSS website](https://boss.codingblocks.com)** and claim the bounty.
