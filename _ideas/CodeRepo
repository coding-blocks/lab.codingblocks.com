Project Name : CodeRepo
Project Type : Web Platform

Problem : As a programmer we all know when we're participating in any Competitive Programming event we write our own code according
to the conditions and type of a problem.But after sometimes in another if we'll find problem based on that tactics we've to start 
write code from scratch.So,we need a platform where we can save our solutions and small notes according to specific tags.
For example:
TagName-Dynamic Programming
Solution Name-ACMprobsol
Solution content-can write code here
Additional NOte-can write additional points here.
We can also share it to our juniors and friends for helping them.

Applications:
> User can use it offline as well as online also.
> User can share any specific directory with friends and all.

Yeah you can say we can also save it on our local but cloud is cool and we'll add some extra functionalities which will not avaible on local.
