At **[Coding Blocks](http://codingblocks.com)**, most of us come from
a vibrant _Open Source_ Community,
and that makes us strongly believe in free and open source software.

Each year we teach hundreds of students coding, programming and software
development. Over the past five years (we started off in April 2014), we
have helped more than 3000 students gain expertise in Android, Web, Data Science
and more.

To be able to stay connected with our alumni, and reach out the wider
community of budding software developers, we launched an annual summer
programme - **BOSS** which stands for _**Bountiful Open Source Summer**_ last year.

We're took inspiration from other such open source summer programmes like
_Google Summer of Code_, _Google Code-In_, _Summer of KDE_, _RGSoC_ and
many others to start our own programme to engage all of you via **BOSS**

_In 2019, we are continuing where we left off, with BOSS 2018, striving to make have bigger projects, more active mentors and much more bounties at stake_

## How will it work ?

At Coding Blocks we have a number of open source projects going on
which on can find here -

#### <http://github.com/coding-blocks>

The objective is to get involved in these projects via contributions
through Github (in form of Pull Requests).

BOSS 2020 starts from **15th May 2020**, after which you'll find
most of our repositories will have issues marked with a _**bounty amount**_

You can check a couple of such issues for example -

- [issue-609, oneauth](https://github.com/coding-blocks/oneauth/issues/609)
- [issue-176, ide](https://github.com/coding-blocks/ide/issues/176)
- [issue-276, motley](https://github.com/coding-blocks/motley/issues/276)

More such issues with bounties will be made by 15th May, and will
continuously keep getting created.

The more bounties you collect, the higher you are on the leaderboard.
To top 10 students as on **15th August 2020** will be BOSS 2020 Winners.

## How to participate ?

Two steps basically.

1.  Pick any open issue **[from here](https://github.com/issues?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3ABOSS+org%3Acoding-blocks)**, solve it and send a pull request to us.
